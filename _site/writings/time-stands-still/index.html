<p>What is this? There is no mirror, and yet I see myself. I am not moving.
Actually, there is nothing moving. I hear… I hear screams, coming from
everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hands reaching each other, male and female…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why am I scared, what is that look on my face? I pause when I see… Oh my!
What is she doing here? I stare at her, watch her beautiful face, her gracious
skin, her penetrating eyes. I walk to her frozen body, her hand is reaching out
to something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eyes penetrating each other, blue and green…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man, is she beautiful. She is scared also. Her hand almost touches me…
Well, the unmoving me. I want to hold her in my arms, feel her body heat over
me. But I can’t, I just pass through her. What is this torture?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screams piercing the air, shrieks and shouts…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kids frozen in their play. Their screams echoing in the streets. I walk to
them, wondering why it won’t stop, how come I hear the screams while no one is
moving. But suddenly, I hear her warm voice over the cacophony of noises. “Where
are you?” I scream.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Souls breaking apart, love and hate…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I run to her. “Why?” I ask, “Why am I going through this?”. I see people,
starting at me, awestrucked. “What is wrong with you people?” I scream at the
top of my lungs. I look at them, they disgust me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Echoing words, the memories and the forgotten…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many times I’ve dwelled to tell her, to scream out my feelings, but each
time, the rush seemed to disappear and leave me empty. I crumble on my knees in
front of her screaming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Loving emotions, in time and space…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was I blind? How could I not see? Am I still blinded? I love you! With all my
heart, I can’t think about life without you! Tears flow flow from my eyes,
burning my skin with grief and sadness. But I my vision is less clouded,
outlines are forming. I can see now, I see everything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blinding light, soothing and scaring…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They say time freezes when you die. Did I want to see? Is this it? Or am I
already dead? Fuck off! I scream at the crowd. Leave me alone! But they won’t
look at me anymore. They never did: they were looking at the bus to the side of
me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tears bursting, fear and sorrow…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I lie my forehead on the road, smashing my fists at the ground, closing my
eyes. I am sorry, I mutter while crying. I scream. I AM SORRY! And suddenly, I
hear new noises, new voices, her voice, her breath on my face, it feels so good.
I open my eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time flowing, beautiful and hopeless…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There she is, she’s never looked that good, my eyes lock with hers, blue into
green, green into blue. I open my mouth slowly, I love you, I say. Tears drop
from her cheeks onto my face, burning even more than mine. I close my eyes, they
hurt too much. I feel the whiteness entering my soul and spirit. I am sorry, I
whisper.</p>
