<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Christian Droulers, I am a young, dynamic and intelligent programmer ready to tackle challenges and learn tons of new things.</p>

<p>I have a few <a href="/projects/">public projects</a> which you can look at.</p>

<p>I am currently living in Lévis, Canada working for <a href="https://www.akinox.com/">Akinox Solutions</a>
as a Software Architect. <a href="https://www.akinox.com/careers/">We’re hiring</a>!</p>

<p>I also volunteer as much as possible for
<a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/">Canada Learning Code</a> and so should you!</p>

<p>I also wish to learn new technologies and new domains of expertise. I’m always on the look-out for interesting techniques and patterns to apply in my every day work.</p>

<p>It is my firm belief that passion is what drives talent and productivity. Programming is my first and most intense passion. For me, development is not just a job, it’s also a hobby and a way of life.</p>

<h3 id="current-work">Current Work</h3>

<p>I’m currently working for <a href="http://akinox.com/">Akinox</a> from home and enjoying it very much.
I currently have a lot of experience in .NET and related Microsoft technologies.
I’m expanding this with Node.JS, Docker, MongoDB, GraphQL, .NET Core and many others.
I would like to expand this knowledge into other realms of programming such as Python, Java, Scala, etc.
I’m not picky about the technologies, as long as I’m working on something interesting and challenging.</p>
