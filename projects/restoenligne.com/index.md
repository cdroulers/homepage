### First real contract! ###
![RestoEnLigne.com logo](/projects/restoenligne.com/logo.jpg)

A first contract that begun in September 2008 on my own time.

The project was to take the old version of the site, made in classic ASP, and to make it modern using
the .NET Framework 3.5, C# and asp.NET MVC. A total do-over of the database was necessary.
LINQ to SQL was used to manage the database while jQuery was used client-side.

A major part of the site was the online orders where users could look at participating restaurants' menus,
add and remove items, quantities, extras, etc. and then process the order directly on the site. From there,
a web service received the order and printed it in the restaurant's special printer.
