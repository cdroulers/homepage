## The new SherWeb Control Panel ##

This control panel is a professional project on which I worked while at SherWeb. Officially released on March 24, 2009, it is in constant development.

The panel is used by SherWeb clients to manage their Exchange 2007, SharePoint 2007, CRM 4 (and others) hosting. They can manage users, mailboxes, distribution lists,
and many other features. Most tasks to manage an Exchange organization are available in a few clicks in an easy to use interface.

This was a first experience in developing a full application for me. Many mistakes were made in architecture and code patterns, but a lot was learned as well.

## Update 2014-03-31 ##

This control panel has been stable for around 5 years now. We barely touch it and there are still a lot of clients on it. We are slowly migrating them to our 2010 or 2013 platform.
