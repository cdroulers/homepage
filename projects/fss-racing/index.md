## A short project for FSS Racing ##

Their website was in need of a quick remake.

I decided to make it mostly static, and use Facebook and Google Spreadsheets for the little bit of dynamic data.

It was built using basic HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. For the JS side of thing, I used RequireJS for module management,
Backbone.js for modeling/fetching data and underscore.js for templating.
