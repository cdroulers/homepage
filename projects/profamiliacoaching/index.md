## A mostly static web site for my father's business ##

Again, it was made statically. But this time, I used an MVC 4 web site (along with a dotless stylesheet and RequireJS).

To build it for publishing, I used Wget on the development server of Visual Studio 2012. Provides great results and gives me the power of .NET to build the site.
