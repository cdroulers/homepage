## UPDATE ##

I'm now using [CMDER](http://cmder.net/) instead of Console2. Works much better and has great customization from the start.

For those who like to have a command line handy while developing (as you should!) and dislike cmd.exe (for extremely valid reasons, I am sure), I have found a good way.

Steps:

1. Setup Console (it's a feature-full replacement for the boring cmd.exe).
    1. Download it [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/).
    1. Extract it where you want. e.g. C:\console
    1. Make sure it's accessible from your [path](http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx). If you put console in C:\console, just add ";C:\console\" to your current one.
    1. Get the pre-made configuration file [console.xml](https://code.google.com/p/cdroulers-utilities/source/browse/#hg%2Ftools%2Fconsole) in my [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/cdroulers-utilities/) and copy it in the Console directory.
1. Setup [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) (it's a tool to set global shortcuts and more in Windows)
    1. [Download](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkeyInstall.exe) and install it.
	1. Get the other configuration file, [quake-terminal.ahk](https://code.google.com/p/cdroulers-utilities/source/browse/#hg%2Ftools%2Fconsole) from the same [repository](http://code.google.com/p/cdroulers-utilities/) and copy it where you like, the AutoHotKey directory is not a bad idea
	1. Finally, put a link to the quake-terminal.ahk in Startup folder of the start menu so you don't have to run it manually every time you start your computer.
1. You are all set! The script is set up to use Ctrl + # (key to the left of "1"), but it can be changed if you edit the file quake-terminal.ahk.

## Final thoughts ##
You can find the original tutorial [here](http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx).

Bonus: Install cygwin and add the bin path to your environment path for awesome unixy tools!
